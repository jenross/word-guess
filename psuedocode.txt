1. Create a program that will randomly choose a word from a word bank 
and hide the letters when it is displayed on the page. 
2. Program a counter that will display the number of guesses the user has
before they lose the game. 
3. The counter should decrease each time a letter is guessed with key press.
4. The incorrect guesses should be displayed so that the user can see what they have already tried. 
5. If the word is guessed before the guesses decrement to 0, the user wins.
6. If the word is not guessed before the guesses decrement to 0, the user loses. 
7. Once a win or loss is incremented, the user gets a different word to guess and plays again. 

still need to get notification to disappear when it resets
when word is guessed, it should display and linger a bit longer (its not showing very last letter) 
would like to have it only take letters to guess (could maybe tack on to first if/else)
would like it to notify if letter is guessed twice (could maybe also tack on to first if/else)
