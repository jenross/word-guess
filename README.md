Check out this simple hangman-style game made with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. I created this for one of the week 3 homework options for the University of Central Florida coding boot camp. I themed the game "The Oregon Trail" (classic) and am still working on adding more features to make it fun and learn more about programming.
